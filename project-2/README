-----------------------------------------------------------------

I started by learning about Python's socket library and API calls.Initially I only wrote code and tested to connect
with the server. When the connection was successful, I read through the protocols in the assignment and started to
code non SSL supported version. After I had success in receiving the secret key from the server. I modified the code to
support SSL as well.

One of the challenges I faced is to create a command line executable program that could directly run on the CCIS Linux
server.

To test:

Run make

then

Run

Non-SSL:

./client cs5700sp17.ccs.neu.edu 001747911

or

./client -p 27993 cs5700sp17.ccs.neu.edu 001747911

or

SSL:

./client -p 27994 -s cs5700sp17.ccs.neu.edu 001747911

or

./client -s cs5700sp17.ccs.neu.edu 001747911
